# Wanderlich  

I wish I traveled more.  
I created this tool while self isolating during the Covid-19 pandemic to  
help me plan imaginary trips.
You can add this app to your own website by following the instructions below

## Getting Started
To host this app yourself you will need:
1. A FourSquare API key
2. An OpenWeather API key

### Installing
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a config file `config.js` with the following code:
    ```javascript
    // Foursquare Info
    const clientId = '';
    const clientSecret = '';
    const url = '';

    // OpenWeather Info
    const OWKey = '';
    const OWUrl = '';
